## **Portfolio Project: Web Development**

This is an overview of my first web development project, a portfolio site with my art and paintings. The main goal was to learn how to work with HTML, SASS and Figma.
This project has been a learning experience. 
I appreciate any feedback and suggestions!

#### Layout Design in Figma: [click-here-to-see-my-figma-layout](https://www.figma.com/file/GoQ6UQWA03ZMIMtr9AgxCT/uib_final_project-portfolio?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=QItJQimTzGYWFR4J-0)
#### Project Plan with Figjam: Sketch on paper and layout in Figma

### Some Challenges and Special Aspects
* Transition from Design to Code in general
* SASS: Issues with nesting and media queries, but recognized the benefits of mixins and variables for writing more clear code
* Custom Cursor with a self-drawn vector graphic
* Keyframe Animations: typed-text animation and <span> elements can cause issues
* Review: Consolidate media queries and move SCSS Mixins to separate files; use Javascript for interactive elements and resizing images in the gallery

#### Insight: Screenshot of the Gallery, build with CSS Grid:
